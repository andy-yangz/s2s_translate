## Sequence to Sequence translator pytorch implementation

#### Date Source from

http://www.manythings.org/anki/

#### To-do 

1. Build a baseline translation system.
   1. One-directional RNN as encoder and decoder.
   2. Have Attention architecture.
2. Using word_embdding as input.
3. Using bi-directional RNN
4. Try more architecture.

About the language, at first try to reimplement system using German to English.
Then try to change it to Chinese to English.
